# Handier

**A fork of [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) that cleans up your dictation before it lands.**

Handy is a free, open source, offline speech-to-text app: press a shortcut,
speak, and your words appear in whatever text field you are in, without anything
leaving your machine. Handier keeps all of that and adds one thing —
a **local enhancement layer** that edits the transcript into what you meant to
write, before it is pasted.

```
you say : um so the meeting is uh moved to friday no wait thursday at three
you get : The meeting is Thursday at three.
```

Everything upstream does still applies; everything below is what the fork adds.

## The enhancement layer

Speech is not writing. You say "um", you start a sentence twice, and — the hard
one — you change your mind halfway through and expect the listener to keep the
second version. A transcriber faithfully writes all of it down.

The enhancement layer is a small language model that runs **on your machine**,
after transcription and before pasting, doing three things at once:

- drops filler words and hesitations
- repairs punctuation, capitalisation and sentence boundaries
- **cuts what you retracted** and keeps only what you settled on

The last one is why this exists, and it is the part general-purpose models of
this size get wrong.

### It has to be fast enough not to notice

The catalogue ships fifteen models, from 153 MB to 2.5 GB, and defaults to
[**handy-editor-lfm2.5-350m**](https://huggingface.co/MagicNoThief/handy-editor-lfm2.5-350m)
— a 350M model trained for this one job rather than a general-purpose model
asked to do it. Against Qwen3-4B Instruct, the smallest stock model that reaches
100% on the self-correction suite:

|                                   | Handier editor | Qwen3-4B (general purpose) |
| --------------------------------- | -------------: | -------------------------: |
| Self-correction suite             |      **68/68** |                      68/68 |
| Held-out exact match (2,152 rows) |      **97.7%** |                          — |
| Median latency                    |    **~100 ms** |                    ~350 ms |
| Size on disk                      |     **379 MB** |                    1.67 GB |

Same accuracy from eleven times fewer parameters, about 3× faster. That trade is
the whole point: this has to run alongside a transcription model on an ordinary
laptop without adding a pause you can feel.

Two builds of it are listed. The default is `Q8_0` (379 MB), which scores
identically to the full-precision weights; `Q4_K_M` (229 MB) gives up 0.3 points
of held-out accuracy to save 150 MB, and is there for machines counting every
one. Qwen3-4B Instruct stays in the catalogue as the general-purpose option, and
is the one to choose if you want the optional verify pass: it re-reads its own
edit, which a model trained only to rewrite cannot usefully do. With the default
editor that pass is skipped rather than faked.

The corpus it was trained on is published too:
[**handy-dictation-editing**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MagicNoThief/handy-dictation-editing)
— 90K rows, 15.6% from recordings of real speech.

### It fails safe

A dictation app that sometimes eats your sentence is worse than one that never
edits it. So every failure path returns the raw transcript:

- mechanical guards reject a rewrite that deleted too much, padded the text,
  invented words the speaker never said, or started talking about the task
  instead of doing it
- the model not loading, timing out, or erroring pastes the original
- the untouched transcript is always kept in history

### Using it

**Settings → Advanced → Local Enhancement** to turn it on, and
**Settings → Models → Enhancement Models** to choose a model — fifteen are
offered, alongside your own.

The **Try it** box on the Advanced page shows what the model does to a sentence
before you trust it with dictation, marking what was cut and what was added:

```
YOU SAID      um so the meeting is uh moved to friday no wait thursday at three
              ‾‾            ‾‾       ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾  (struck through)
HANDY WRITES  The meeting is Thursday at three.
```

### Bring your own model

**Models → Enhancement Models → Your Own Model → Choose a GGUF file…** points
Handier at any GGUF on disk, with no Hugging Face upload in the loop. Set
**How to prompt this model** to match how it was trained:

| Setting                      | Sends                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Fine-tuned for editing       | An empty system turn — for a chat fine-tune |
| Fine-tuned from a base model | The Alpaca prompt as one turn               |
| General-purpose model        | Handy's full instruction prompt             |

Getting this wrong does not fail loudly, it fails _quietly_, so the setting is
explicit rather than guessed. The tooling to train and measure your own is in
[`scripts/enhance-train/`](scripts/enhance-train/) and
[`scripts/enhance-eval/`](scripts/enhance-eval/); the latter's README is a
step-by-step guide to benching a checkpoint.

### How it runs

Inference happens in a **separate process** (`handy-llm`), not in the app. A
crash or an out-of-memory in a language model takes down the sidecar and leaves
your dictation working. It uses Vulkan on Windows and Linux and Metal on macOS,
falling back to CPU when no usable device is present.

## Building

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for the base app. The enhancement sidecar needs one
extra step:

```bash
bun run build:sidecar          # GPU build
bun run build:sidecar:cpu      # CPU-only, no Vulkan/Metal toolchain needed
```

On Windows the GPU build additionally needs `LIBCLANG_PATH`, the Ninja
generator, and a short `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` — each of those is a hard failure, not
a warning. The exact incantation is in
[`src-tauri/crates/handy-llm/README.md`](src-tauri/crates/handy-llm/README.md).

## Licences

Handier is MIT, inherited from upstream Handy (Copyright (c) 2025 CJ Pais).

Models are downloaded at runtime rather than bundled, and **not all of them are
under open-source licences** — LFM2.5 carries Liquid AI's own terms, Gemma
Google's, and Llama 3.2 Meta's. The model picker shows the licence for each.

See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for the full accounting,
including the MPL-2.0 components and the MIT-licensed llama.cpp linked into the
sidecar.

## Relationship to upstream

Handier tracks [cjpais/Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) and exists
because upstream is under a feature freeze and has declined local-LLM additions.
Everything the fork adds is confined to the enhancement layer; the transcription
path is upstream's and stays that way, so fixes flow in cleanly.

If you want plain, excellent offline dictation with no language model in the
loop, use upstream — it is the better choice for that, and this fork is a
superset you do not need.

---

_Everything below this line is inherited from upstream Handy and applies equally
to the fork._

## Why Handy?

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn't trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it's trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut: hold it to record and release to stop, or tap it to toggle recording on and off (Hold-only and Toggle-only modes are also available)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you're using

The process is entirely local:

- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

Installers for Windows, macOS and Linux are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/MagicNoThief/Handier-desktop/releases).
Building from source works too — see [Building](#building) above, and
[BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

Upstream Handy's own binaries are on its
[releases page](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases) or
[handy.computer](https://handy.computer). Those do **not** include the
enhancement layer.

### Development Setup

For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `transcribe-cpp`: Local speech recognition with Whisper-family models (GGML/GGUF)
  - `transcribe-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:

- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

### CLI Parameters

Handy supports command-line flags for controlling a running instance and customizing startup behavior. These work on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux).

**Remote control flags** (sent to an already-running instance via the single-instance plugin):

```bash
handy --toggle-transcription    # Toggle recording on/off
handy --toggle-post-process     # Toggle recording with post-processing on/off
handy --cancel                  # Cancel the current operation
```

**Startup flags:**

```bash
handy --start-hidden            # Start without showing the main window
handy --no-tray                 # Start without the system tray icon
handy --debug                   # Enable debug mode with verbose logging
handy --help                    # Show all available flags
```

Flags can be combined for autostart scenarios:

```bash
handy --start-hidden --no-tray
```

> **macOS tip:** When Handy is installed as an app bundle, invoke the binary directly:
>
> ```bash
> /Applications/Handy.app/Contents/MacOS/Handy --toggle-transcription
> ```

## Known Issues & Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Bluetooth Headset Microphones (macOS)

Using a Bluetooth headset microphone on macOS may temporarily reduce playback quality or volume while recording because Bluetooth switches to bidirectional audio. Keep your headphones as the output device and select your Mac's built-in or an external microphone in Handy to avoid this.

### fn and Globe Key Shortcuts (macOS)

Shortcuts that include the `fn` (Globe) key **only work on Apple keyboards** — your Mac's built-in keyboard or an Apple external keyboard. They will never trigger on a third-party keyboard, even while it is connected to the same Mac.

This is a hardware limitation rather than a Handy bug. `fn` is not part of the standard USB HID keyboard specification: Apple reports it through a vendor-specific usage that macOS honors only from Apple devices, while third-party keyboards handle their `Fn` key entirely in firmware and send nothing to the computer. There is no event for Handy to listen for.

If you switch between a MacBook keyboard and an external one, pick a shortcut built from standard modifiers (`ctrl`, `option`, `shift`, `command`) or a regular key instead.

### Major Issues (Help Wanted)

**Whisper Model Crashes:**

- Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)
- Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
  - If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!

**Wayland Support (Linux):**

- Limited support for Wayland display server
- Requires [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) or [`dotool`](https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/) for text input to work correctly (see [Linux Notes](#linux-notes) below for installation)

### Linux Notes

**Text Input Tools:**

For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:

| Display Server | Recommended Tool | Install Command                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| X11            | `xdotool`        | `sudo apt install xdotool`                         |
| Wayland        | `wtype`          | `sudo apt install wtype`                           |
| Both           | `dotool`         | `sudo apt install dotool` (requires `input` group) |

- **X11**: Install `xdotool` for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts
- **Ubuntu 26.04**: Has Wayland display server by default. `wtype` does not work, you need to install `ydotool` and configure systemd as described [here](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/557#issuecomment-3781249267).
- **Wayland**: Install `wtype` (preferred) or `dotool` for text input to work correctly
- **dotool setup**: Requires adding your user to the `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` (then log out and back in)

Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.

**Other Notes:**

- **Runtime library dependency (`libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`)**:
  - Handy links `gtk-layer-shell` on Linux. If startup fails with `error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`, install the runtime package for your distro:

    | Distro        | Package to install    | Example command                        |
    | ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | Ubuntu/Debian | `libgtk-layer-shell0` | `sudo apt install libgtk-layer-shell0` |
    | Fedora/RHEL   | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo dnf install gtk-layer-shell`     |
    | Arch Linux    | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell`       |

  - For building from source on Ubuntu/Debian, you may also need `libgtk-layer-shell-dev`.

- The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (`Overlay Position: None`) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.
- If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` may help
- If Handy fails to start reliably on Linux, see [Troubleshooting → Linux Startup Crashes or Instability](#linux-startup-crashes-or-instability).
- **Global keyboard shortcuts (Wayland):** On Wayland, system-level shortcuts must be configured through your desktop environment or window manager. Use the [CLI flags](#cli-parameters) as the command for your custom shortcut.

  **GNOME:**
  1. Open **Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
  2. Click the **+** button to add a new shortcut
  3. Set the **Name** to `Toggle Handy Transcription`
  4. Set the **Command** to `handy --toggle-transcription`
  5. Click **Set Shortcut** and press your desired key combination (e.g., `Super+O`)

  **KDE Plasma:**
  1. Open **System Settings > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
  2. Click **Edit > New > Global Shortcut > Command/URL**
  3. Name it `Toggle Handy Transcription`
  4. In the **Trigger** tab, set your desired key combination
  5. In the **Action** tab, set the command to `handy --toggle-transcription`

  **Sway / i3:**

  Add to your config file (`~/.config/sway/config` or `~/.config/i3/config`):

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec handy --toggle-transcription
  ```

  **Hyprland:**

  Add to your config file (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`):

  ```ini
  bind = $mainMod, O, exec, handy --toggle-transcription
  ```

- You can also trigger Handy externally via Unix signals or the CLI flags, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings:

  | Action                                    | Trigger                                                  |
  | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Toggle transcription                      | `pkill -USR2 -n handy` or `handy --toggle-transcription` |
  | Toggle transcription with post-processing | `handy --toggle-post-process`                            |

  Example Sway config:

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy
  bindsym $mod+p exec handy --toggle-post-process
  ```

  `pkill` here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.

  > **Behavior change:** older releases also accepted `SIGUSR1` for toggling transcription with post-processing. WebKitGTK — the webview engine embedded in Handy on Linux — uses SIGUSR1 internally to coordinate JavaScript garbage collection, so listening for it caused phantom recordings and interrupted dictations every few minutes ([#1660](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/1660)). Handy no longer listens for SIGUSR1 on Linux; the post-processing toggle is still available via `handy --toggle-post-process`. **Remove any `pkill -USR1` bindings**: the signal is now delivered straight to WebKit's internal handler and can crash the app.

**Overlay & Pasting Issues (Linux):**

- The recording overlay window can interfere with pasting transcribed text into target applications on Linux (X11)
- **Solution:** Open **Settings > Advanced** and set **"Overlay Position"** to **"None"** to disable the overlay
- Enable **"Audio Feedback"** (also in Advanced) if you still want audible confirmation of recording state
- Users who upgrade from older versions or import settings from other platforms may need to manually apply this change

### Platform Support

- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don't meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**

- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  - Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**

- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

## Roadmap & Active Development

We're actively working on several features and improvements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### In Progress

**Debug Logging:**

- Adding debug logging to a file to help diagnose issues

**macOS Keyboard Improvements:**

- Support for Globe key as transcription trigger
- A rewrite of global shortcut handling for MacOS, and potentially other OS's too.

**Opt-in Analytics:**

- Collect anonymous usage data to help improve Handy
- Privacy-first approach with clear opt-in

**Settings Refactoring:**

- Cleanup and refactor settings system which is becoming bloated and messy
- Implement better abstractions for settings management

**Tauri Commands Cleanup:**

- Abstract and organize Tauri command patterns
- Investigate tauri-specta for improved type safety and organization

## Verify Release Signatures

Handier release artifacts are signed with Tauri's updater signature format, using the fork's own key (not upstream's). The public key is stored in [`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`](src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) under `plugins.updater.pubkey`.

To verify a release manually, set `ARTIFACT` to the filename you downloaded, save the `pubkey` value from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to `handy.pub.b64`, then decode the public key and matching `.sig` file from base64 and verify the artifact with `minisign`:

```bash
# Replace with the file you downloaded
ARTIFACT="Handier_0.9.6_x64-setup.exe"

python3 - "$ARTIFACT" <<'PY'
import base64, pathlib, sys

artifact = sys.argv[1]

pub = pathlib.Path("handy.pub.b64").read_text().strip()
pathlib.Path("handy.pub").write_bytes(base64.b64decode(pub))

sig = pathlib.Path(f"{artifact}.sig").read_text().strip()
pathlib.Path(f"{artifact}.minisig").write_bytes(base64.b64decode(sig))
PY

minisign -Vm "$ARTIFACT" \
  -p handy.pub \
  -x "$ARTIFACT.minisig"
```

On success, `minisign` prints:

```text
Signature and comment signature verified
```

Do not use `gpg` for these `.sig` files.

## Troubleshooting

### Manual Model Installation (For Proxy Users or Network Restrictions)

If you're behind a proxy, firewall, or in a restricted network environment where Handy cannot download models automatically, you can manually download and install them. The URLs are publicly accessible from any browser.

#### Step 1: Find Your App Data Directory

1. Open Handy settings
2. Navigate to the **About** section
3. Copy the "App Data Directory" path shown there, or use the shortcuts:
   - **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D` to open debug menu
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open debug menu

The typical paths are:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.magicnothief.handier/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\com.magicnothief.handier\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/com.magicnothief.handier/`

#### Step 2: Create Models Directory

Inside your app data directory, create a `models` folder if it doesn't already exist:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.magicnothief.handier/models

# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:APPDATA\com.magicnothief.handier\models"
```

#### Step 3: Download Model Files

Download the models you want from below

**Whisper Models (single .bin files):**

- Small (487 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-small.bin`
- Medium (492 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/whisper-medium-q4_1.bin`
- Turbo (1600 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin`
- Large (1100 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin`

**Parakeet Unified EN 0.6B (single `.gguf` file, recommended):**

- Q8_0 (731 MB): `https://huggingface.co/handy-computer/parakeet-unified-en-0.6b-gguf/resolve/main/parakeet-unified-en-0.6b-Q8_0.gguf`

**Parakeet Models (compressed archives):**

- V2 (473 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v2-int8.tar.gz`
- V3 (478 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v3-int8.tar.gz`

#### Step 4: Install Models

**For Whisper Models (.bin files):**

Simply place the `.bin` file directly into the `models` directory:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── ggml-small.bin
├── whisper-medium-q4_1.bin
├── ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin
└── ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin
```

**For GGUF Models (.gguf files):**

Place the `.gguf` file directly into the `models` directory, exactly like the Whisper `.bin` files above. Handy also picks up models already present in the shared Hugging Face cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub`), so a copy downloaded by another tool works without being moved.

**For Parakeet Models (.tar.gz archives):**

1. Extract the `.tar.gz` file
2. Place the **extracted directory** into the `models` folder
3. The directory must be named exactly as follows:
   - **Parakeet V2**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`
   - **Parakeet V3**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8`

Final structure should look like:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
│   ├── (model files)
│   └── (config files)
└── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
    ├── (model files)
    └── (config files)
```

**Important Notes:**

- For Parakeet models, the extracted directory name **must** match exactly as shown above
- Do not rename the `.bin` or `.gguf` files—use the exact filenames from the download URLs
- After placing the files, restart Handy to detect the new models

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Restart Handy
2. Open Settings → Models
3. Your manually installed models should now appear as "Downloaded"
4. Select the model you want to use and test transcription

### Custom Whisper Models

Handy can auto-discover custom Whisper GGML models placed in the `models` directory. This is useful for users who want to use fine-tuned or community models not included in the default model list.

**How to use:**

1. Obtain a Whisper model in GGML `.bin` format (e.g., from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?search=whisper%20ggml))
2. Place the `.bin` file in your `models` directory (see paths above)
3. Restart Handy to discover the new model
4. The model will appear in the "Custom Models" section of the Models settings page

**Important:**

- Community models are user-provided and may not receive troubleshooting assistance
- The model must be a valid Whisper GGML format (`.bin` file)
- Model name is derived from the filename (e.g., `my-custom-model.bin` → "My Custom Model")

### Linux Startup Crashes or Instability

If Handy fails to start reliably on Linux — for example, it crashes shortly after launch, never shows its window, or reports a Wayland protocol error — try the steps below in order.

**1. Install (or reinstall) `gtk-layer-shell`**

Handy uses `gtk-layer-shell` for its recording overlay and links against it at runtime. A missing or broken installation is the most common cause of startup failures and can manifest as a crash or a hang well before any window is shown. Make sure the runtime package is installed for your distro:

| Distro        | Package to install    | Example command                        |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Ubuntu/Debian | `libgtk-layer-shell0` | `sudo apt install libgtk-layer-shell0` |
| Fedora/RHEL   | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo dnf install gtk-layer-shell`     |
| Arch Linux    | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell`       |

If it is already installed and you still see startup problems, try reinstalling it (e.g. `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell` again) in case the library files were corrupted by a partial upgrade.

**2. Disable the GTK layer shell overlay (`HANDY_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL`)**

If installing the library does not help, you can skip `gtk-layer-shell` initialization entirely as a workaround. On some compositors (notably KDE Plasma under Wayland) it has been reported to interact poorly with the recording overlay. With this variable set, the overlay falls back to a regular always-on-top window:

```bash
HANDY_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL=1 handy
```

**3. Disable WebKit DMA-BUF renderer (`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER`)**

On some GPU/driver combinations the WebKitGTK DMA-BUF renderer can cause the window to fail to render or to crash. Try:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 handy
```

**Making a workaround permanent**

Once you've found a flag that helps, export it from your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshenv`, …) or from the desktop autostart entry that launches Handy. If you launch Handy from a `.desktop` file, you can prefix the `Exec=` line, e.g.:

```ini
Exec=env HANDY_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL=1 handy
```

If a workaround helps you, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues) describing your distro, desktop environment, and session type — that information helps us narrow down the underlying bug.

### Handy Starts or Stops Recording on Its Own (Linux)

Handy 0.9.4 and earlier listened for `SIGUSR1` as a remote-control trigger. WebKitGTK — the webview engine embedded in Handy on Linux — uses that same signal internally to coordinate JavaScript garbage collection, so GC cycles were misread as hotkey presses: recordings started on their own, or real dictations were cut off mid-sentence (typically ~2 minutes in). See [#1660](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/1660).

Update to a newer release, and replace any `pkill -USR1 -n handy` keybindings with `handy --toggle-post-process`.
